## Introduction
A smart contract allows for Alice to guarantee something to Bob: for example she can guarantee she’s not a spammer. The particular smart contract in mind is a Hashed Time-Locked Bond, of which more below; however the [Hashed Time-Locked Contract](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0199.mediawiki) would also work. Neither are implemented in the Bitcoin wallet as yet (March 2019), although both work in the main daemon, with the latter integral to creating [Lightning Network](http://lightning.network/) channels. Berewic’s first, smaller, job is to implement the smart contract on behalf of clients until the reference wallet or other better facility does it for them.

For Alice to know what kind of guarantee Bob wants requires that Bob declares the details in advance. The second job of Berewic is then to assist Bob in declaring to the network what it takes to access his resource.

Next, Alice and Bob need to negotiate some of the terms of a bond, particularly what the address of the bond will be; Berewic’s third job is thus to structure that negotiation for its particular owner.

In this document bitcoin prices are denoted thus: “B2.5”, satoshi prices thus: “30,000s”.

## Background
The Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) on the Bitcoin network is a short script that says “Alice can redeem the funds after timestamp X, Bob can redeem the funds at anytime as long as he has secret Y.”

Assuming Bob already knows secret Y, there are circumstances where Bob would *not* immediately redeem all the funds: if Bob is incentivised for Alice’s repeat custom, he would prefer not to take them. If Alice wants to redeem those funds then she’s incentivised to keep Bob happy. We say:  
* Alice is incentivised inside the contract to good behaviour outside it;  
* Bob is incentivised outside the contract to good behaviour within it.  

A good example use case would be a robocall, where a computer rings up and plays a prerecorded message. Indeed many robocalls see the recipient billed for receiving it. Imagine Alice is Bob’s daughter and she has a new telephone number; she wants to call her Dad but knows he doesn’t pick up strange numbers as they’re usually robocalls.

She sends her Dad 20,000s along with the telephone call, good for three hours. Now Bob sees the call arrive and instantly knows: someone is guaranteeing him 20,000s that he wants to receive this call. And if he disagrees for any reason at all, he has three hours to take those funds at their expense. Bob takes the call. 

Bob wants Alice to stay in touch, so he declines to redeem those funds in the three hours and she gets them back: Bob behaved inside the contract. For her part, Alice refrained from selling Bob encyclopaedias: she behaved outside the contract.

Back to Alice’s Secret Y, it turns out no one benefits from it in this kind of transaction: it adds to the things to store, it adds to the processing required but offers nothing in return. However if *Bob* has the Secret Y, the HTLB can be so constructed that at his election, Alice can be informed of it and so redeem the funds before the timeout; Alice can have an instant refund.

Bonds are also passive in that Bob need not lift a finger. While Alice could *pay* Bob B1.2 for a bond, and Bob could *pay* Alice the B1.2 back if she was compliant, this has problems:  
* The risk that Bob falls under a bus before he can pay Alice back;
* The risk that Bob loses access to those funds.

In an HTLB if Bob does nothing, Alice will get regain access to her funds. 

## Use cases
### Bonding qua bonding
Conceptually, bonding can find use wherever there is:
* a venue (eg server, real estate) that manages …
* a resource (eg a URL, a particular room between particular times) and that …
* has an effective mechanism for enforcing against access (eg http basic access authentication, a lock and key)

The following examples is by no means exhaustive.
* **Webpages, websites** Particularly where expensive processing is offered to anonymous users raising the prospect of Denial of Service, a single page, group of them or entire website can require posted bond: that DoS vector then becomes a revenue stream.
* **Email** Two thirds of email is spam. If sending a spam costs 30,000s per spam spammers will run out of money faster than hitherto.
* **Social media** Trolling occurs in large part because comment is free: by requiring a posted bond beforehand low quality contributions can be effectively penalised. 
* **Telephone** Robocalling, unsolicited faxes, and obscene calls are all discouraged by a requirement to guarantee the receiver desires to receive the call particularly in networks where victims are required to pay to receive such calls. VOIP packages such as Skype would similarly benefit given the number of unsolicited connections the author has received.
* **Restaurants** Dine and Dash is effectively prohibited where the reservation requires bonding beforehand. Similar abuses include making off without paying public transit and taxi fares, automobile fuel charges and similar defrauding of innkeepers.
* **Connectivity** VPN exit points might well offer free access below 1Gb per IP per month, then 30,000s for the next 1 Gb. With bonding they can reduce their freeloader problem in favour of a client pool who guarantee that they’ll pay for that second gigabyte if they use it.
* **Group chat** Whether in an app such as Telegram, a listserv mailing list, a teamspeak session, a facebook group or IRC session, requiring a bond before posting would be an effective way of denying access to abusers: abuse would see part or all of their bond forfeited.
* **Property Rental** As a deposit against damages, Alice guarantees Bob one month’s rent. If she leaves everything in order, Bob declines to redeem any funds and Alice redeems them all.
* **Bail Bond** Judge Bob requires Alice to post bail, good for one year, against her appearance at trial expected to be in ten months. Anxious not to visit gaol too early, Alice complies.
* **No-Shows** Doctor's surgeries have a problem in the UK with people booking an appointment then not turning up. Rather than take names, email addresses and inside leg measurements for nagging, they can take a 100,000s bond to appear returned if and when patients actually do appear.

### Bonding in Reverse
Instead of Alice posting bond to Bob guaranteeing she won’t abuse his resource, Alice can demand a guarantee from Bob that his content won’t abuse her connection. For example, Alice’s browser determines that she wants to visit http://<i></i>www<i></i>.example.com, however that site’s source requests that she download something from http://<i></i>advertising.example.com.  Alice’s browser could then demand of that second site a guarantee that what’s about to be served is not an objectionable advert. If it is, the advertiser gets punished. If no guarantee is received the advert is not retrieved at all. 

### Bonding as payment
Whether an HTLB is a bond or a payment is ultimately decided outside the contract. For example, Alice knows full well that Bob is her son but nevertheless uses her telephone to call him with a B0.25 bond guaranteeing he wants the call. He does - he’s stony broke - and he redeems half the B0.25 shortly after. 

Thus, adoption of crypto bonding drives adoption of crypto payment.

An additional advantage of bonding as payment is that if Bob above spends half then loses his phone, Alice can still redeem the other half. 

### Other benefits
**Community moderation** The automation of bonding raises the ability of communities to moderate on their own, without the need for lower level janitors and moderators: code can be used to note complaints, raise juries, assess verdicts and effect remedy. 

**Onramping** The vision for properly securing servers involved in bonding suggests server owners could serve to onramp their real life social group. Need some satoshis? Ask among your computerate friends.

**Wider VPN offerings** It can be imagined that residential users will offer VPN exit points in return for cryptocurrency.

## Model
### Overview
Alice wants access to a resource on Bob’s server, however he wants strangers to bond their good behaviour first. She’ll need to use software that’s Berewic Aware to do so: a Berewic User Agent or BUA. (Completing the sequence manually is supported, but will be ignored for now.) For the purpose of the demopage, Alice-BUA will be your web browser, and Bob-Server will be the web server (neither must be, we’ll show variations later). Bob doesn’t want to manually handle bonding requests from strangers so he has a Berewic Transfer Agent or BTA do it instead. Alice finds it convenient to have her own BTA too, as it’s easier to find apps that can use a BTA than apps that handle cryptocurrency within themselves (or through an OS call), just as it’s easier to find apps that can use a SMTP server than find apps that implement an SMTP server.
Each BTA presents a RESTful Front End.

### Detail 
* The two BTAs interact with each other only via the blockchain
  * Each BTA may communicate with more than one blockchain (not shown)
  * Each BTA may be accessible through the public Internet and/or through TOR or alternative network that supports TCP
  * A later revision might see them talk to each other directly, perhaps over a second layer network such as Lightning. 
    * When you consider that if Alice is likely to continue to want to access Bob’s resource (say a social media page), and Bob is likely to want her to continue to (why would you want fewer quality visitors?), there’s no reason the bonds must immediately be on-chain. As Bob very likely knows others with whom Alice interacts, Bob’s BTA would be a reasonable place for a Lightning node
    * TODO: The author is not at all certain Lightning yet supports bonds as imagined in this document
  * Each BTA is envisioned as a common or garden computer running both berewicd (the front end software), and each respective wallet (the back end software) as a daemon. 
  * Each daemon uses whatever method it needs to access its own blockchain.
  * Front end and daemon currently communicates over RPC.
  * Front end will use HTTP to communicate with each BUA
    * demopage uses HTTPS
* Bob owns the server and his BTA but otherwise has no direct role to play
  * He might get involved later to redeem Alice’s bond for wrongdoing but that’s not part of this protocol.
* Alice does have a direct input: she initiated the protocol by the connections she made, and her BUA will want to confirm with her that the details of the bond are actually acceptable to her. 
  * A later revision might see her BTA also confirm instructions directly with her, perhaps with a 2FA feature such as OTP Authenticator
* Bob’s server and BTA do not need to communicate directly, but do so indirectly via Alice-BUA. 
  * That is, Bob passes penalties etc to Alice, Alice passes them to Bob’s BTA.
  * TODO. Communicating via Alice-BUA allows her to track what’s happening, and that would be reputationally better for Bob. OTOH it offers Alice one free abuse: she could make it a biggie then never forward the penalty, forgoing access in order to redeem the whole value of the bond at expiry. Having server communicate directly with BTA is bad, not least it requires different firewall arrangements, and a more featured Berewic-aware capability on the server. Or perhaps queue changes to be sent and have Bob send them during scheduled maintenance. Or, SHOULD be sent via Alice during service window, MAY be sent directly only after service window (defined at the demopage) expires but before bond expires
  * Communicating via Alice-BUA is safe because Bob-Server and Bob-BTA both share a secret that Alice does not know, and that secret is used in a HMAC to authenticate messages sent via her BUA
    * This use of HMAC also means Alice can be sure at every step of what it’s being agreed to, as everything else travels in plain text (although in a secured connection)
    * HMAC also means that a log of what was agreed to at each step can be kept by both sides so that neither side can later lie about what was agreed
    * TODO: I should like to add some signing process by which it can be established by some third party that logs were signed in the presence of a particular private key. This avoids problems with one party changing their private key then claiming not to have ever possessed the original. Alice can then publish incontrovertible evidence of Bob’s malfeasance
  * Bob’s server and BTA could be the same device but it’s not necessary and may well be better to be separate: it keeps the keys well away from the service being accessed for a start, and makes it easier to federate BTAs later.
    * Federated BTAs are two or more BTAs any one of which can answer for the server, providing a measure of resiliency
    * Alice-BTA and Bob-BTA could be the same BTA instance; there’s no changes yet considered if this is so, though a very obvious one exists: Alice & Bob could transact completely off-chain.
## Types of server, types of resource
Alice is trying to access a resource on Bob’s server. Both those terms should be used in their widest possible sense. That server could be:
* A computer of any description
* A telephone
* A restaurant, with the resource being a table near the window from 7pm to 8.30pm

That resource can be:
* **Addressable** such as a URL or a telephone number, where the address resolves to single endpoint. These resources can be directly covered by having the endpoint check the bond status. Here, that might be Apache httpd or the phone app.
  * The demopage BTA implements the endpoint using PHP
  * Addressable resources can implement bonding in the client and daemon at clear points in the code: it’s abundantly clear when a given address is in use.
* **Nonaddressable** such as an IRC channel or in game teamspeak session to which there is no public identifier. With no direct way to handle out-of-band data, inband methods can help. For IRC that’s commands like /nick; for teamspeak that could use stegonographical techniques with the audio: while inband, Berewic aware clients would hide the transfer, legacy clients (or their users) would ignore it.
  * For more info read Alice Bonds an IRC Channel at http://berewic.com/manually-bond.html
  * A lot more work is required from client and daemon to establish if bonding is required as it’s a configuration state of a channel that counts, not the address in use
  * If client or daemon does not handle bonding, bots at either end can do it by scraping the content passing through
* **Offline** such as a restaurant booking or city transit journey which is not experienced online. While there is obviously a need for the commitment to be online, the bond is provably good even in the absence of connectivity.
  * A QR code represents a convenient way of presenting it: the confirmation code is encoded as a QR which is then printed or otherwise captured as an image. As required that image is validated offline by being decoded back into a string which is then processed as normal. As the HMAC can be validated if the secret is known, connectivity is not needed.
  * A city transit journey by Alice may look like this: At the first entry gate of the day her phone bonds 200,000s that she’ll pay her fare within 2 hours, and she boards the train; she travels two stops and disembarks; the exit gates detect her entry point and calculate her bill of 10,000s, deducting it from the bond. A few hours later her phone automatically redeems the remaining 190,000s back to her credit. In cities such as London, England where there’s a daily cap on such charges, Alice could guarantee that cap for up to 24 hours, with successive charges drawing down, the remainder being returned to her credit afterwards.   
* **Duplexed** sees two channels used in the communication - one ‘inband’ carrying data, the second ‘out of band’ carrying control and metadata. HTTP is duplexed, as is FTP, Skype sessions, SSH etc
* **Simplexed** sees a single channel used for both data and control, with context deciding which is which. An SMS group chat is simplex, as is IRC, a city transit journey and hotel reservation.

### Examples
* **Addressable, duplex**: HTTP  
Addressable: rfc7230 etc defines URL scheme  
Duplex because of headers/body division  
Headers can be extended to define and handle bonding either in the daemon httpd or server-side scripting such as PHP or Perl
* **Addressable, simplex**: mailman, listserv  
Addressable because a mailing list can be addressed by its “-request” email address  
Simplex because the contents of the subject line (“subscribe”/“unsubscribe”) control behaviour  
With no control side-channel, the protocol must be extended first, lest bonding control be mistaken for user contribution. That is, add “send bond details” et alii as a controlled subject line.  
* **Nonaddressable, duplex**: WhatsApp group chat  
Nonaddressable as no scheme by which a particular group chat can be referenced. Rather, users required to download a client and await an invite  
Duplex as status changes etc are not negotiated by control verbs visible to others  
* **Nonaddressable, simplex**: IRC  
IRC has no URL scheme by which a single URL leads to “#bobchannel on DALnet”. Rather there are multiple URLs that can get you there as well as multiple routes not involving URLs, such as configuring a client.   
* **Offline, duplex**: a court hearing  
Nonaddressable: there’s no uniform identifier that indicates a court hearing at a particular time, and place. Further, it is not experienced online. Not withstanding that the court will have a postal address, room number etc, what works in one jurisdiction is not uniform with what works in another.  
Duplex: the control of a court hearing resides in multiple sources: a magistrate may deal in relatively simple and minor decisions as to who is or is not guilty and what justice demands, the clerks concerns themselves with what process and the law demands, the police with what security demands, that a lawyer properly represents the interests of the defence.  
Consider that a court can require a Bail Bond, and such a transaction exactly matches a Good Behaviour Bond.  
* **Offline, simplex**: a rental  
Nonaddressable: there’s no uniform scheme by which a particular property at a particular time may be located  
Simplex: the lesee is entirely responsible in all aspects for the control of his side of the lease, that sums are transacted properly, that terms are adhered to.  
Consider that a rental deposit exactly matches a Good Behaviour Bond.
