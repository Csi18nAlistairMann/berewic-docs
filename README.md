Documentation for Berewic-v1

For the Berewic Proof of Concept go to http://berewic.com/, with its github at https://github.com/Csi18nAlistairMann/berewic-poc    
For Berewic-v2, please wait a bit.

Berewic-v1 aims to provide a Berewic prototype revealing the issues to be addressed.

## BIP-HTLB
A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal for a hashed time-locked bond (HTLB.)  
Berewic starts out by using bitcoin-denominated bonds to guarantee good behaviour. Ideally, such a bond would be available through the wallet, however work on that stalled with https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7601. I'm hoping Berewic in general and BIP-HTLB in particular will generate interest in looking further at it.

## RFC-BEREWIC-1
Berewic Exchange in the Abstract.    
Berewic is about guaranteeing good behaviour to a wide range of resources both on and offline. This Request For Comment styled document describes how that can happen.

## RFC-BEREWIC-2
Berewic Exchange over HTTP.    
Taking RFC-BEREWIC-1 above, this document applies the lessons to protecting an HTTP resource.

## RFC-BEREWIC-3
berewicd API.   
Reserved for later. The expectation is that if version 1 berewicd proves its worth, a formal treatment of the API will appear here for version 2. 

## RFC-BEREWIC-3exp
Expedient berewicd API.  
'Expedient' is the internal name for the first version of the berewicd prototype: the API described within has been created on the fly as the expedience of the moment requires.
