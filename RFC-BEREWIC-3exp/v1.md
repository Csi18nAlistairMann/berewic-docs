Placeholder for description of Berewic-v1's API

The following were in the original notes but do not belong in RFC-BEREWIC-1 as they describe features outside of the protocol

A Berewic server can implement bonds because it has access to a hot wallet. The security measures envisioned lend themselves well to ledger possession of funds to users, subusers, & individual applications. Whoever controls those funds may wish to sell access to some part of them, and so Berewicâ€™s fourth job is to assist with that transfer.

Ledger ownership. While the BTA may from time to time issue unique blockchain addresses to persons using it, the hot wallet utilised is the property of the BTA owner, not the person to whom the address was issued. 
If the hot wallet contains 500,000s, the database will track that Alice owns 40,000s of them, Carol 80,000s of them. 
Also note it may be desirable that the address issued is that of a cold wallet, with the balance being made available from a different hot wallet.
This does mean Bob needs twice the funds, but also means he can publish his reserves without revealing as much as inputs are more disassociated from outputs

 It is, however, a facility him offered by the BTA: /redemptions/N, redeem amount/percentage/bond percentage
